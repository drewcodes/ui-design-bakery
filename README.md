# Bake Shop UI Design Concept

This concept design was inspired by a stay-at-home mom who wanted to pursue her own bake shop after completing a pastry program at a NYC culinary school. After researching some other sites for bake shops, cupcakes and pastries, it became apparent that most other sites had a lot of "content clutter" that made the user experience a bit overwhelming. The goal of this design was to simplify the interface so that even an 80 year old grandparent should be able to place an order for cupcakes without much confusion.

-The tone and concept of the bake shop is set with a large image of cupcakes, along with a friendly font.

-The menu is immediately available for viewing below the main image. Conceptually, users will want to know about the products first, then the shop's details later.

-The menu layout is responsive and automatically divides the different types of products available.

-The background details of the shop is presented in a simple display that doesn't distract from the business' main goal: Showcasing and selling its products.

-A simple footer without a contact form was selected to encourage potential customers to contact the shop directly with their inquiries. A phone number and location would be provided, so that the potential customers can quickly interact with the shop on a personal level and immediately create a friendly buying experience.

-Additional content can be added, such as a reviews section or links to a review site like Yelp.
